Just waiting for me — a big, looming blank space — full of nothing. Just waiting for me.\n\nBut it don't have to be. You know what I mean? There's something I've been thinking about. Something that could change everything for us. I'm talking about a real business. A real chance to be somebody in this world.\n\nI know you think I'm dreaming again. But what's wrong with dreaming? Every great thing in this world started with somebody's dream. And I'm not talking about sleeping dreams. I'm talking about the kind that keep you awake at night. The kind that make your hands shake and your heart pound.\n\nI just need somebody to believe in me. Just once. That's all I'm asking.`,

I descended the steps of this fire escape for a last time and followed, from then on, in my father's footsteps, attempting to find in motion what was lost in space.\n\nI traveled around a great deal. The cities swept about me like dead leaves, leaves that were brightly colored but torn away from the branches. I would have stopped, but I was pursued by something.\n\nOh, Laura, Laura, I tried to leave you behind me, but I am more faithful than I intended to be!`,

What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?\n\nYet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? The Thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean?\n\nNo more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting. Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!`,

Which, honestly, felt appropriate.\n\nBecause here's the thing — I didn't just send a text. I sent THE text. The "hey, I like you" text. To my coworker. Who sits THREE FEET from me. Every. Single. Day.\n\nAnd now it's been forty-seven minutes and they haven't responded. Not even the little dots. You know the dots? The three little dots that mean someone is typing? Nothing. Radio silence. Digital void.\n\nI've already planned three different escape routes out of the office for tomorrow. One involves the fire escape, one involves a very convincing fake mustache, and the third is just... moving to Portugal.`,

Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\n\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\n\nWhat's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title.`,

    text: `You want to know what it's like? Fine. I'll tell you.\n\nIt's like sitting in a waiting room. Every single day. You wake up and you're in this room with fluorescent lights and outdated magazines and a clock that ticks so loud it's practically screaming at you. And you're waiting.\n\nWaiting for the phone to ring. Waiting for the callback. Waiting for someone — anyone — to look at you and say, "Yes. Her. She's the one."\n\nAnd some days the door opens and it's not your name they call. And you smile at whoever it is because that's what you do. You smile and you say congratulations and you mean it, mostly. And then you sit back down. And you wait.\n\nBut here's what nobody tells you about the waiting room — it's where you become who you are. Every rejection, every "almost," every "we went another direction" — it all builds something in you that nothing else can.`,

The one that says "I'm a functioning adult who definitely owns more than one good shirt."\n\nEverything's going great. The conversation's flowing, she's laughing at my jokes — which, let's be honest, is the real miracle here. And then the food arrives.\n\nNow, I ordered spaghetti. And I know what you're thinking. "Spaghetti? On a first date? Are you insane?" And the answer is yes. Yes, I am.\n\nBecause within thirty seconds, I've got marinara sauce on my chin, my shirt, somehow my forehead — I don't even know the physics of how that happened. I look like a crime scene.\n\nAnd she just looks at me. Dead silence. And then she reaches across the table, wipes the sauce off my forehead, and says, "You've got a little something." And somehow, that was the moment I fell in love.`,

And I smiled and said thank you and walked out of that room with my head held high because that's what professionals do.\n\nBut when I got to my car? When I was finally alone? I screamed. I screamed so loud I scared a pigeon off the parking structure. Sorry, Gerald. That's what I named him. We have a relationship now.\n\nThe thing is, I know I'm good. I KNOW it. Not in an arrogant way — in a way that hurts. Because knowing you're good and having nobody else see it? That's its own special kind of torture.\n\nBut I'll go back. Tomorrow, next week, next month. I'll walk into another room and I'll do it again. Because this thing — this crazy, beautiful, heartbreaking thing we do? It chose me. And I don't know how to be anything else.`,

And yes, all of that is real and all of that is exhausting.\n\nBut nobody warns you about the quiet. About standing in the doorway of their room at two a.m. watching them sleep and feeling like your heart might actually burst. Like your chest literally cannot contain the amount of love that's in it.\n\nOr the moment they look up at you with those eyes — those impossible, perfect eyes — and say something so small and so huge at the same time, like "Mama, will you always be here?" And you want to say yes. God, you want to say yes.\n\nBut instead you kneel down and you hold them and you say, "I'm here right now. And that's what matters."`,
