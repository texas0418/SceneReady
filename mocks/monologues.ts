Something that could change everything for us. I'm talking about a real business. A real chance to be somebody in this world.\n\nI know you think I'm dreaming again. But what's wrong with dreaming? Every great thing in this world started with somebody's dream. And I'm not talking about sleeping dreams. I'm talking about the kind that keep you awake at night.

She is the most organized human being on the planet. She color-codes her spice rack. She has a spreadsheet for her spreadsheets. She once made a pros and cons list about whether to make a pros and cons list.\n\nAnd then she met David. David, who once wore two different shoes to work. For an entire day. And didn't notice. David, who thinks "planning ahead" means deciding what to have for dinner while he's already eating dinner.\n\nAnd somehow — SOMEHOW — these two disasters found each other. And it works. It works because she reminds him where his keys are, and he reminds her that not everything needs a plan. She gives him structure. He gives her chaos. And together they make the most beautiful, functional, slightly unhinged life.\n\nSo raise your glasses. To the spreadsheet and the lost shoe. May they never find balance. Cheers.`,

    text: `This suitcase. This is the one. The one my mother packed the night before we left. She said, "Only what matters." Only what matters. How do you fit a life into forty-four pounds?\n\nShe chose photographs over winter coats. She chose my grandmother's recipe book over a second pair of shoes. She chose the tiny wooden cross that hung over our front door — the one my father carved before I was born — over her own wedding dress.\n\nI was eleven. I didn't understand why we were leaving. I didn't understand why my mother was crying while she folded my school uniform so carefully, like she was tucking it into bed for the last time. I didn't understand that the sound the door made when we closed it behind us was permanent.\n\nBut I understand now. I understand that my mother didn't just pack a suitcase that night. She packed a promise. A promise that whatever we were walking toward had to be worth everything we were walking away from.\n\nI still have the suitcase. The zipper is broken and the handle is held on with tape. But I keep it. Because my mother taught me — you carry what matters.`,

My best friend. My brother from another mother. The guy who once ate an entire jar of pickles on a dare and then blamed me when he threw up in my car.\n\nWe've been through everything together. Middle school, where we had matching haircuts that I can only describe as "crimes against humanity." High school, where he convinced me to try out for the baseball team even though my hand-eye coordination is — and this is a direct quote from our coach — "medically concerning."\n\nCollege, where he talked me off more ledges than I'd like to admit. Not literal ledges. Emotional ledges. The kind where you're three energy drinks deep at two a.m. wondering if you've made a terrible mistake with your entire life.\n\nAnd he'd always say the same thing. He'd say, "Kev. Relax. It's going to work out." And then it would. Because somehow, when Mike says it, you believe it.\n\nSo, Sarah — you're getting a guy who makes people believe things will work out. That's not nothing. That might be everything, actually.`,

    text: `People ask me how I do it. How I stand over a table for twelve hours with someone's life literally in my hands and not fall apart.\n\nThe answer is: I don't think about it. Not during. During, there's only the procedure. There's only the next cut, the next suture, the next breath on the monitor. It's almost peaceful, actually. The quietest my mind ever gets.\n\nIt's after. After is when it hits you. You're standing at the scrub sink and your hands are shaking and you can't remember if you ate today and somewhere down the hall there's a family and you have to go tell them something. Good or bad. And you have about thirty seconds to decide what your face is going to look like when you walk through that door.\n\nI lost one today. She was thirty-four. Same age as me. She had two kids and a husband who kept calling her phone from the waiting room, and every time it rang in the OR, my hands got a little less steady.\n\nThey don't teach you that in medical school. They teach you anatomy and pharmacology and suture technique. They don't teach you what to do with the weight of it after.`,

Like, this is the same room where I had my first dinner party — if you can call boxed wine and frozen pizza a dinner party. This is where I stayed up all night writing that terrible screenplay that I was sure would change my life.\n\nThat wall. That wall right there. That's where I hung up my first headshot. I used a thumbtack because I couldn't afford a frame, and I stared at that picture every morning and thought, "Okay. You can do this. You can be this person."\n\nI'm not that person anymore. I mean, I am. But different. Better, I think. Definitely more tired. Significantly more in debt. But better.\n\nEveryone says your twenties are supposed to be the best years of your life, which — if that's true, we're all in serious trouble. But they were something. They were loud and messy and confusing and beautiful and mine.\n\nSo. New city. New apartment. New thumbtack on a new wall. Same dream, though. The dream stays the same.`,

    text: `Fifty years. Can you imagine? Fifty years since I first walked onto a stage and forgot every single line I'd rehearsed. Just stood there, blinking into the lights like a deer on the highway. The stage manager had to whisper my opening line three times before my brain remembered how to make words.\n\nAnd now they're giving me a lifetime achievement award. For a lifetime of achieving things, I suppose. Though most of my career felt less like achievement and more like controlled falling.\n\nI've played queens and servants. Mothers and daughters. Saints and sinners. A surprisingly large number of nurses — apparently I have a very "nursey" face, whatever that means.\n\nBut here's what I know after fifty years of pretending to be other people: every character taught me something about myself. Every role peeled back another layer. You'd think after fifty years there'd be nothing left, but it turns out there's always another layer. Always another truth hiding underneath the last one.\n\nSo thank you. For watching me search. For sitting in the dark and letting me make a fool of myself, night after night, in the most glorious way. The theater is a place where we agree to believe impossible things together. And I cannot think of a better way to have spent a life.`,

Darkness.\n\nSo I'm sitting there, I can't see my food, I can't see him, I can't see my own hands. I accidentally dipped my bread in his water glass. I put salad dressing in my coffee. At one point, I'm pretty sure I was holding hands with the person at the next table.\n\nAnd he's across from me talking about his "spiritual journey" and how he spent three months in a silent retreat, which — okay, great, but maybe mention that before the entrée arrives, because now I'm nodding in the dark and he can't even see me nod.\n\nBut then — and I don't know why — I laughed. A real laugh. The kind that comes from somewhere deep and surprised. And he laughed too. And we sat there in the dark, two strangers cracking up over nothing, and I thought: this might actually be okay.\n\nHe's still weird. But it turns out I am too. So.`,

Like she was trying to hold me to the earth. Like if she let go, I'd float away.\n\nHe said the word again. More carefully this time. Like saying it slower would make it smaller. It didn't.\n\nThat was six months ago. Six months. And I want to tell you that I'm brave. I want to tell you that I looked this thing in the face and said something heroic. But that's not what happened. What happened is I went home and I sat in my garage and I stared at the wall for two hours. And then I got up. And I made dinner. Because the kids were hungry and the world doesn't stop just because yours does.\n\nThat's not bravery. That's Tuesday. That's getting up and doing the next thing because the next thing still needs doing. And maybe that's enough. Maybe that's all bravery ever was.`,

We're like the bass line of a song. You don't hear it until it's gone, and then everything sounds wrong.\n\nSo yes. I am Villager #3. I carry a fake basket and I wear shoes that are two sizes too big. And every night, I stand on that stage in the park with mosquitoes eating me alive and tourists talking on their phones, and I think: I'm in a Shakespeare play. I'm doing the thing. I'm actually doing it.\n\nVillager #3 for life.`,

The kitchen is also the bedroom is also the living room. I can touch all four walls if I stand in the middle and stretch.\n\nBut Mama — last Tuesday I walked past a theater. A real theater, with lights and a marquee and people lining up to get inside. And I stopped. And I looked at that building. And I thought: one day. Not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day I'm going to walk through those doors and I'm not going to be in the audience.\n\nThat's why I'm here. That's why any of this is worth it. Because the dream is still alive.
